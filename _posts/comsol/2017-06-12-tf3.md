To advance the interface: Given a velocity field, u  
The evolution equation becomes 

∂φ / ∂t + u ⋅ ∇φ = 0  

Interfacial geometric quantities can be easily calculated using φ 
n=∇φ |∇φ|,κ=∇⋅n 

difficulties: not conservative  
loss or gain of mass (area) due to numerical diffusion 

> The **Volume-of-Fluid (VOF)** method is the oldest method to advect a marker function and—after many improvements and innovations—continues to be widely used. Other marker function methods include the **Level-Set** method, the **Phase-Field** method, and the **CIP** method. Instead of advecting the marker function directly, the **boundary** between the different fluids can also be tracked using marker points, and the **marker function** then **reconstructed from the location of the interface**. Methods using **marker points** are generally referred to as “**front-tracking**” methods to distinguish them from “**front-capturing**” methods were the **marker function is advected directly**.
