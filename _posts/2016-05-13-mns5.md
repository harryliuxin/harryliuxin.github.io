**Polymerization** is the process by which small molecules consisting of one unit (known as a **monomer单体**) or a few units (known as **oligomers低聚物**) are chemically joined to create these giant molecules.

大多数polymers是有机物; however, polymers can be inorganic (eg. silicones硅酮 based on Si-O network).

containing additives such as fibers纤维, fillers填料, pigments颜料。

Plastics include thermoplastics热塑, thermosets热固, and elastomers弹性体 (natural or synthetic).
