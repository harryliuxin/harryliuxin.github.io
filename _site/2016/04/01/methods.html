<p>##1. Kjeldahl Method: 
This method determines total nitrogen in protein to find out total concentration of protein. protein% = N * 6.25</p>

<p>##2. Biuret Method: 
Using the reaction of biuret and CuSO4 to form purple complex and find out concentration by comparing A540 with standard curve.</p>

<p>##3. Folin Method: 
Based on Buret method, add Folin to enhance the color and sensitiveness of detection of protein.</p>

<p>##4. Absorbance at 280nm: 
Protein absorbs strongly at 280 nm due to a number of its constituent aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine.</p>

<p>##5. BCA:<br />
The total protein concentration is exhibited by a color change of the sample solution from green to purple in proportion to protein concentration, which can then be measured using colorimetric techniques.</p>

<p>##6. Bradford Assay: 
Bradford Assay is a rapid and accurate method commonly used to determine the total protein concentration of a sample.</p>

<p>##7. ELISA: 
enzyme-linked immunoab sorbent assay requires the generation of antibodies. It uses the immune-technology which can detect target-specific protein concentration.</p>
